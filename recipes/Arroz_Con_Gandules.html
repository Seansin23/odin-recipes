    <h4>
    <p>Few dishes summon nostalgic memories of family and 
        festivity quite like arroz con gandules, a fragrant 
        and beloved Puerto Rican classic. You can usually find 
        it at family reunions, Christmas dinner, New Year’s 
        celebrations or any other festive holiday. Normally, 
        it is served alongside <em>pernil</em> — the king of the holiday
         table and the chief representative of togetherness
          and heritage. It is accompanied by <em>ensalada de 
          coditos</em> — a slightly sweet and tangy creamy macaroni
           salad. Translated, the name means rice with pigeon
            peas. However, this seemingly straightforward meal
             is surprisingly complex in how its flavors are 
             layered and its colors orchestrated.  
             Its intoxicating aroma acts as a siren as it calls 
             the attention of the uninitiated and has the 
             ability to turn even the pickiest of eaters into 
             fans.</p></h4>

	<p>Recipes and approaches to this dish are as numerous as 
        the population on the island, so in order to keep 
        things simple, I will be sharing my mother’s recipe, 
        which captures her idiosyncrasies while also staying 
        faithful to traditional conceptions.</p>
	<p>She would start off her rendition by cubing either bacon 
        or ham, this decision was usually made for her as it was 
        determined by whatever she had available. Once cubed, she 
        would throw the pieces into a large, cold, round bottom 
        aluminum pot known as a caldero. Unbeknownst to many, the 
        caldero is actually one of the ingredients for this recipe 
        as it plays an integral role in the formation of <em>
            pegao</em>, 
        or the crispy rice that is left behind in the pot that 
        serves as a delicious savory, nutty snack for those that 
        love different textures.</p>
	<p>Once settled in the pot, she would set her gas range 
        stove to medium heat, lighting the gas with a lighter 
        since the pilot did not work and the only thing one 
        would hear is <em>click-click-click-click</em>. Now with the 
        flame burning, the fat would begin to render and the 
        house would be inundated with the smell of breakfast. 
        Once most of the fat was rendered, the meat would turn 
        golden brown and the bottom of the pan would be plated 
        with fond. At this stage, my mother would then add her 
        homemade sofrito, since the frozen version from the 
        store just wasn’t up to her standards. 
        To most accurately describe what sofrito is 
        and why it is the cornerstone of all Puerto Rican 
        cooking, it’s best to first list what makes up this 
        concoction.</p>
<p>A blend of onion, garlic, cilantro, culantro, sweet peppers, 
    and a splash of olive oil; sofrito is the foundation of 
    countless Hispanic Caribbean recipes and the flavor base of 
    our Arroz con gandules. Once added to the pot, this 
    herbaceous mixture releases an aroma so intoxicating, the 
    inhabitants of the house where this dish is being prepared 
    will respond like:</p>

    towards a smell">

<p>Once aromatic, the next steps happen quickly. Pigeon peas, 
    olives, adobe seasoning, a packet of sazón and the rice are 
    all added to the pot. Quickly, these ingredients are mixed 
    and allowed to get to know one another. Once properly 
    introduced and married, just enough water and beer 
    (my mother’s secret) was then added to cover the rice and 
    the pot was then brought to a boil. She always said that 
    the alcohol would boil off but it would impart another 
    layer of depth. Once boiling, the flame was lowered to lo, 
    and the caldero was topped with its lid. It would only be 
    about twenty more minutes until the lid could be removed, 
    the rice fluffed and the festivities could begin properly.</p>
