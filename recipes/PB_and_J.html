    <h1>Peanut Butter and Jelly</h1>

     <h4><p>A peanut butter and jelly sandwich is a simple, classic 
        American snack or meal made by spreading creamy or crunchy 
        peanut butter and sweet fruit jelly (or jam) between two 
        slices of bread. The peanut butter adds a rich, nutty 
        flavor and smooth or crunchy texture, while the jelly 
        brings a burst of sweetness and fruity contrast. Typically 
        made with white or whole wheat bread, it's easy to 
        prepare, kid-friendly, and beloved for its perfect balance 
        of salty and sweet. It can be enjoyed cold or toasted, and 
        is often paired with a glass of milk for a nostalgic, 
        satisfying treat.</p></h4>

        <li>2–3 tablespoons peanut butter (creamy or 
            chunky)</li>

            depending on your preference.</li>
        <li>Place on a plate or napkin and enjoy with a glass
