    <h4><p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering 
        sheets of pasta with rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel 
        or ricotta cheese, and melted mozzarella, then baking 
        it until golden and bubbling. The meat sauce typically 
        includes ground beef or pork simmered with tomatoes, 
        garlic, onions, and herbs like oregano and basil. The 
        result is a hearty, savory casserole with a comforting 
        blend of textures and flavors—soft pasta, robust sauce, 
        and gooey cheese in every bite. Variations can include 
        vegetables, different meats, or even seafood, making 
        lasagna a versatile and beloved comfort food around the 
        world.</p></h4>
